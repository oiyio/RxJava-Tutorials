    /**
     * This example uses window() operator. We are using a variant which accepts a timespan and a count parameters. This means that it will
     * emit an observable either when "count" is reached or when timespan expires.
     *
     * Basically, if it emits an empty observable, it means user did not type anything within 5 seconds. So we will hide typing indicator
     * message. When it emits any value, it means user typed something. So, we will show typing indicator message.
     *
     * The problem is that when user types something, window() operator makes current window to be emitted, but it will only start another
     * window either if user types something else (which makes it to start and close a new window and emit it immediately) or after the latest
     * timespan expires.
     *
     * Let's see an example:
     *
     * At time 0:  a new window is started (which is expected to be opened for 5 seconds)
     * At time 1:  user types letters 'aaa'. Current window is closed and those items are emitted. This will make typing indicator message to
     * appear.
     * At time 5:  another window is opened.
     * At time 10: window is closed: Only now typing indicator message is gone, since now window operator emitted an empty observable.
     * Here typing indicator message was visible for 9 seconds.
     * At time 14: user types letter 'b'. Current window is closed and that item is emitted. This makes typing indicator message to appear.
     * At time 15: another window is opened.
     * At time 20: window is closed: Only now typing indicator message is gone. Now typing indicator message was visible for 7 seconds.
     *
     * We can see that behavior mentioned above when user typed some characters at time 1 making current window to be emitted immediately, but
     * only at time 5 it started a new window and emitted it only after 5 seconds (i.e.: at time 10).
     *
     * Since we want to make typing indicator message to be gone EXACTLY after 5 seconds user stop typing, this does not fit our needs.

     *
     * For the variant we are using, it will always emit something when it's timespan elapses, regardless whether it is fewer than count. This means
     * that our buffer() operator will emit each 5 seconds, no matter what happens. Within this period, if user types something, that item will be
     * emitted (since count = 1), and when it elapses 5 seconds since its last bundle emission, it will emit an empty list, making our typing indicator
     * message to be gone.
     *
     * Using buffer() operator differs a little than using window(), but still does not fit what we are looking for since if user types something
     * right before timespan elapses (e.g.: 500ms before), typing indicator message will be visible for a very short period of time.
     *
     * Let's see an example:
     *
     * At time 0:  a new timespan is started (which is expected to be opened for 5 seconds)
     * At time 1:  user types letters 'aaa'. These items are emitted. This will make typing indicator message to appear.
     * At time 5:  the first timespan elapses, so an empty list is emitted making typing indicator message to be gone. Notice that the indicator
     * message was visible for only 4 seconds.
     * At time 9:  user types letter 'b'. This item is emitted. This will make typing indicator message to appear.
     * At time 10: the latest timespan elapsed, so an empty list is emitted making indicator message to be gone. It was visible for only 1 second.
     *
     * We clearly see that by using buffer operator, the effect is the opposite than when using window() operator. Depends on the period of its timespan
     * user types something, typing indicator message will be visible from some milliseconds to up to 5 seconds.

     * According to the docs, amb() operator can have multiple source observables, but will emit all items from ONLY the first of these Observables

     * So, if user types something, it will emit that value and ignore its timer (from the second observable). On the other hand, if the "5 seconds timer"

     * indicator message. When it contains any value, we show the typing indicator message.
