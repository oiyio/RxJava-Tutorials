     * This example demonstrates how to ask our observable to be executed in another thread than that one subscribe method was

     * create our own Scheduler implementation, but this is out of scope of this example.
     *
     * Also we are using observerOn() operator to instruct our observable to emit notifications to its observable using Android
     * mainThread.
     *
     * xxx
     *
     * When using subscribeOn, we decide on what Scheduler the Observable.create (or any static method which implicitly calls
     * it) is executed.
     *
     * observeOn controls, on the other hand, the other side of the pipeline, instructing Observable to perform its emission
     * and notifications on a specific scheduler.
     *
     * Important to note that when calling subscriberOn, no matter at what point in the chain of operators it is called, it
     * designates which thread the Observable will begin operating on.
     *
     * Note this will not make emissions to happen in parallel, but all of them will happen in another thread, but synchronously
     * on that thread.
     *
     *
     * From the docs:
     *
     * "By default, an Observable and the chain of operators that you apply to it will do its work, and will notify its observers,
     * on the same thread on which its Subscribe method is called. The SubscribeOn operator changes this behavior by specifying a
     * different Scheduler on which the Observable should operate. The ObserveOn operator specifies a different Scheduler that
     * the Observable will use to send notifications to its observers."
     *
     * xxx
     *
     * One last note: Schedulers.newThread is not recommended to use for intensive computational work (exactly what we are doing in
     * our heavyDataProcessing method) since computational work is expected to use CUP intensively and Schedulers.newThread theoretically
     * can create unlimited threads, which might decrease the performance. But, since this example is only intended to demonstrate
     * how to run an observable in another thread than the mainThread, we will use Schedulers.newThread to show each emission will be
     * processed in a different thread.
